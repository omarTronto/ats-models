# EASSE
[**EASSE**](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-3009/) (**E**asier **A**utomatic **S**entence **S**implification **E**valuation) is a Python 3 package aiming to facilitate and standardise automatic evaluation and comparison of Sentence Simplification systems. ([*What is Sentence Simplification?*](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/coli_a_00370))

We edited EASSE to evaluate German simplification systems. We made the following changes to the original:
- [x] removed some English resources (turkcorpus, qats and pwkp kept for tests)
- [x] added script to add German resources  [easse/install.sh](easse/install.sh) on sentence and document level
- [x] added evaluation metrics for German data
  - [x] Flesch Reading Ease adapted by Amstad (1978)
  - [x] Wiener Sachtextformeln following Bamberger & Vaneck (1984)
  - [ ] G-SMOG adapted by Bamberger & Vaneck (1984)
  - [ ] Dickes & Steiwer (1977)
  - [ ] Tränkle & Bailer (1984)
  - [ ] Readability Index of Cologne for Language (KVIS) by Jussen (1983)
  - for more see Kercher (2013, p. 192ff) 
- [x] added copy baseline (source text copied) 
- [x] added German tokenizer (spacy, also applicable for other languages)
- [ ] pytest with German datasets and German metrics
- [ ] document-level evaluation metrics (D-SARI)
- [ ] language independent sentence splitting (with spacy?) in easse.utils.text.to_sentences()
- [ ] make samsa language independent, see here for other ucca model https://github.com/orgs/UniversalConceptualCognitiveAnnotation/repositories https://github.com/huji-nlp/ucca/issues/113
- [ ] read me on interpretation of values. also add arrow up or aroow down on table header of report


### Features

- Automatic evaluation metrics (e.g. SARI<sup>1</sup>, BLEU, SAMSA, etc.).
- Commonly used [**evaluation sets**](https://github.com/feralvam/easse/tree/master/easse/resources/data/test_sets).
- Literature [**system outputs**](https://github.com/feralvam/easse/tree/master/easse/resources/data/system_outputs) to compare to.
- Word-level transformation analysis.
- Referenceless Quality Estimation features.
- Straightforward access to commonly used evaluation datasets.
- Comprehensive HTML report for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a simplification output.

[1]: The SARI version in EASSE fixes inconsistencies and bugs in the original version. See the dedicated section for more details.

## Installation
### Requirements

Python 3.6 or 3.7 is required. 
In Python 3.8, the nltk.tokenizer sentence splitter splits the sentence differently, hence the test does not work anymore. 
For example, the sentence "presidential candidate john f . kennedy proposed the peace corps on the steps of michigan union in 1960 ." 
is plit into sentences in 3.7 but not in 3.8.

### Installing from Source

Install EASSE by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/feralvam/easse.git
cd easse
pip install -e .
```

This will make `easse` available on your system but it will use the sources from the local clone
you made of the source repository.

### Python

You can also use the different functions available in EASSE from your Python code.

```python
from easse.sari import corpus_sari

corpus_sari(orig_sents=["About 95 species are currently accepted.", "The cat perched on the mat."],  
            sys_sents=["About 95 you now get in.", "Cat on mat."], 
            refs_sents=[["About 95 species are currently known.", "The cat sat on the mat."],
                        ["About 95 species are now accepted.", "The cat is on the mat."],  
                        ["95 species are now accepted.", "The cat sat."]])
Out[1]: 33.17472563619544
```

## Metrics
[Interpretation of metrics.](easse/Metric_Interpretation.md)

## Differences with original SARI implementation

The version of SARI fixes inconsistencies and bugs that were present in the original implementation. The main differences are:
1) The original SARI implementation applies normalisation (NIST style tokenization and rejoin ‘s, ‘re ...) only on the prediction and references but not on the source sentence (see STAR.java file). This results in incorrect ngram additions or deletions. EASSE applies the same normalization to source, prediction and references.
2) The original SARI implementation takes tokenized text as input that are then tokenized a second time. This also causes discrepancies between the tokenization of the training set and the evaluation set. EASSE uses untokenized text that is then tokenized uniformly at runtime, during evaluation. This allows for training models on raw text without worrying about matching the evaluation tokenizer.
3) The original JAVA implementation had a silent overflow bug where ngram statistics would go beyond the maximum limit for integers and silently start over from the minimum value. This caused incorrect SARIs when rating too many sentences but did not raise an error.

## Information to Tokenizers
- _13a_: sacrebleu.tokenizers.tokenizer_13a.Tokenizer13a
  - "Tokenizes an input line using a relatively minimal tokenization that is however equivalent to mteval-v13a, used by WMT."
- _intl_: sacrebleu.tokenizers.tokenizers_intl.TokenizerV14International
  - "Tokenizes a string following the official BLEU implementation."
- _moses_: sacremoses.MosesTokenizer()
- _penn_: sacremoses.MosesTokenizer().penn_tokenize()
- _none_: sacrebleu.tokenizers.tokenizers_none.NoneTokenizer.()
  - No tokenization applied.
  - please choose this option, if your data is already tokenized.
- _spacy_
  - tokenization based on spacy models. 
  - Can be specified for German or other languages.
  - in comparison to the other tokenizers, rather slow
